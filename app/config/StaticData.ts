    lead: "The European Union has enacted the Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive, holding developers accountable for harms caused by high-risk AI systems — a global first.",
    body: "In a landmark move for digital rights, the EU has passed the Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive, effective January 2026. The law establishes a clear legal framework for victims of AI-related harm—such as biased hiring algorithms, faulty medical diagnostics, or autonomous vehicle crashes—to seek compensation.\n\nUnder the new rules, companies deploying high-risk AI must maintain detailed technical documentation and allow independent audits. Crucially, the burden of proof is partially reversed: if a victim can show an AI system was used and harm occurred, the developer must prove their system wasn’t at fault.\n\n“This isn’t about stifling innovation,” said EU Digital Commissioner Thierry Breton. “It’s about ensuring that as AI transforms our lives, human rights and safety remain non-negotiable.”\n\nTech giants and startups alike now face a 12-month compliance window. Meanwhile, the U.S. and India are drafting similar frameworks, signaling a potential global shift toward accountable AI.",

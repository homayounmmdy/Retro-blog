# Building Design System in Storybook 

## Button 

this is the world simplest story 

```tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { Button } from './button';

const meta = {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
} satisfies Meta;

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>;

export const Primary: Story = {};


```

here also how can build multiply parts and customize each with the args.

```tsx 

export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    style: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },
  },
};

export const Secondary: Story = {
  args: {
    children: 'Secondary',
  },
};

```

meta is sharing things across all the components like if you add args in meta it will add 
into all other components if you set for component like Secondary it will use Secondary but for 
the Primary that you don't set children it will use meta children 

```tsx 
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { Button } from './button';

const meta = {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
  args : {
    children : 'Button'
  }
} satisfies Meta;

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>;

export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    style: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },
  },
};

export const Secondary: Story = {
  args: {
    children: 'Secondary',
  },
};

```

## Variants 

In design system we have so many variants like 

- primary 
- danger
- secondary
- ghost
- etc ..

> but one thing you remember is if your brand is red and you put the primary as red and 
> red has meaning for danger and you have to think about this too.

for the most design system all around world mostly used variant but also you can use kind or appearance 

> do not use boolean and you will be regret it because something like this might happen 

```html
<Button primary secondary>
  Button
</Button>
```

defiantly typescript will stop you but this is not good practice to do this at all and you will regret later.
